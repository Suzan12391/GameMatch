**GameMatch** is a memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to match pairs of images within a limited time. As you progress, the number of images increases and the time limit for each level becomes shorter.

## How to Play?

1. The game features a set of images that are duplicated to form pairs.
2. The goal is to match the images by clicking on them.
3. Each level has a countdown timer, and you must match all the images before time runs out.
4. If you successfully match all images before the timer runs out, you'll progress to the next level.
5. If time runs out and you haven't matched all the images, a message will inform you that you lost.

## How to Play:

- **Starting the Game:** Once the game begins, the countdown timer will start.
- **Interacting with Images:** Click on the images to reveal them and match them with other images.
- **Levels:** With each new level, the number of images increases and the available time becomes shorter.

## Technologies Used:

- **HTML:** The structure of the game and display of content.
- **CSS:** Styling the layout and user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Game logic, handling image interactions, and implementing the timer.



### Requirements:

- **Modern Browser** to run the game correctly.
